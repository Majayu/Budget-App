Based on the screenshots, it appears there may be issues with either the PHP backend (`fetch_budget.php`) or the database connection. Let's troubleshoot and resolve this step by step:

---

### 1. **Check PHP Errors**
When you visit `http://192.168.1.254/fetch_budget.php`, the blank page indicates that PHP is not returning anything. Follow these steps to debug:

#### Enable PHP Error Reporting:
1. Open the PHP configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/php/7.x/apache2/php.ini
   ```
   (Replace `7.x` with your PHP version, e.g., `7.4` or `8.0`.)

2. Look for the following settings and update them:
   ```ini
   display_errors = On
   display_startup_errors = On
   error_reporting = E_ALL
   ```
3. Save and exit (`CTRL + O`, then `CTRL + X`).

4. Restart Apache to apply changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```

5. Reload `http://192.168.1.254/fetch_budget.php` in your browser. You should now see error messages that can help identify the issue.

### 2. **Test the Database Connection**
The issue might be related to the database credentials or structure.

#### Create a Database Test Script:
1. Create a new PHP file (e.g., `db_test.php`):
   ```bash
   sudo nano /var/www/html/db_test.php
   ```

2. Paste the following code:
   ```php
   <?php
   $servername = "localhost";
   $username = "admin";
   $password = "P@ssw0rd";
   $dbname = "family_budget";

   // Connect to the database
   $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

   // Check connection
   if ($conn->connect_error) {
       die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
   }
   echo "Database connection successful!";

   // Test query
   $result = $conn->query("SHOW TABLES");
   if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
       echo "<br>Tables in database:";
       while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
           echo "<br>" . $row["Tables_in_$dbname"];
       }
   } else {
       echo "<br>No tables found in the database.";
   }

   $conn->close();
   ?>
   ```

3. Save the file and open it in your browser:
   ```
   http://192.168.1.254/db_test.php
   ```

4. **Expected Results**:
   - If the connection is successful, youâ€™ll see a list of tables.
   - If not, the script will show an error message that can help pinpoint the problem.

### 3. **Check fetch_budget.php**
If the database connection works, the issue might be in `fetch_budget.php`. Revisit this script to ensure:
- **Correct SQL Queries**: Double-check the `SELECT` statements.
- **Proper Output**: Ensure `echo json_encode($data);` is called.

---

### 4. **Check Browser Console**
In your frontend (e.g., `http://192.168.1.254/index.html`), open the browser console (`F12` or `CTRL + SHIFT + J` on most browsers):
- Check for errors in the **Console** or **Network** tabs.
- Look for failed requests to `fetch_budget.php` and examine the status code (e.g., `404`, `500`).
Clear your browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + R or Cmd + Shift + R on Mac).

---

### 5. **Common Issues**
Here are a few things to double-check:
1. **Permissions**: Ensure `fetch_budget.php` and other files in `/var/www/html` are readable by the web server:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod 644 /var/www/html/fetch_budget.php
   ```
2. **Database Structure**: Ensure the `family_budget` database exists and contains the expected tables with data.
3. **PHP Modules**: Ensure required PHP modules (e.g., `mysqli`) are installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install php-mysqli
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```

### Let Me Know:
1. The error messages after enabling PHP error reporting.
2. The output of the `db_test.php` script.
3. Any errors from the browser console or network tab.

This will help identify and resolve the issue!
