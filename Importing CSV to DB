Steps to Import Excel Data into MySQL
1. Convert Excel to CSV

MySQL works best with CSV files for data imports.

    Open your Excel file and save it as a CSV file:
        In Excel: File > Save As > CSV (Comma delimited).
        Save the file on your Ubuntu machine, e.g., /home/username/data.csv.

2. Prepare Your MySQL Table

Ensure the MySQL table structure matches the columns in your CSV file. If necessary, create the table.

Example SQL for the Alba table:

CREATE TABLE Alba (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Month VARCHAR(20),
    Capital_One FLOAT,
    Sally_Fashion FLOAT,
    Truist FLOAT,
    Synchrony_Gato FLOAT,
    Macys FLOAT,
    Navy_Federal FLOAT,
    Personal_Cards FLOAT,
    Loan_By_Alex FLOAT,
    Grand_Total FLOAT
);

3. Import CSV into MySQL

    Copy the CSV File to the Server Move your CSV file to a directory where the MySQL user can access it, such as /var/lib/mysql-files/. Run the following command:

sudo cp /home/username/data.csv /var/lib/mysql-files/

Ensure the file has the correct permissions:

sudo chmod 644 /var/lib/mysql-files/data.csv

Use MySQL's LOAD DATA INFILE Command Import the CSV data into your MySQL table:

    LOAD DATA INFILE '/var/lib/mysql-files/data.csv'
    INTO TABLE Alba
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
    ENCLOSED BY '"'
    LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
    IGNORE 1 ROWS
    (Month, Capital_One, Sally_Fashion, Truist, Synchrony_Gato, Macys, Navy_Federal, Personal_Cards, Loan_By_Alex, Grand_Total);

        IGNORE 1 ROWS skips the header row in the CSV file.
        Replace Alba with the name of the table you're importing into.

4. Verify the Data

After the import, verify that the data was added correctly:

SELECT * FROM Alba;

Troubleshooting Tips

    CSV File Permissions: If you encounter file access errors, ensure the MySQL user has permission to read the file.

    MySQL secure_file_priv Restriction: If LOAD DATA INFILE is restricted by MySQLâ€™s secure_file_priv, you might need to modify the configuration:
        Open the MySQL configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf

Add or update:

secure_file_priv = "/var/lib/mysql-files/"

Restart MySQL:

    sudo systemctl restart mysql

Excel Formatting:

    Ensure there are no extra blank rows or columns in the CSV.
    Ensure numeric columns contain only numbers.
